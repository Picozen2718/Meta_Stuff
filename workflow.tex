\section*{Publishing System and workflow:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is just a means of communication and not the end goal. You can't spend a lot of time on manuscripts. It should be a byproduct of your work.
    
    \item The MIT guy who used to publish a lot, wrote \& updated the manuscripts in the meeting. Don't make intermediate notes to upload at a later point if you could just do it on that day itself!
    
    \item Overall you need to improve your file management. Maybe it's time to start using \textbf{Obsidian}? But papers, your summaries, your technical notes, your ideas $\rightarrow$ all this should be maintained properly.
    
    \item Also your LaTeX workflow could be so much more better! Overleaf pro? Alternative $\rightarrow$ set it up.
    
    \item Updating webpage, LinkedIn should be streamlined \& also your reflections.
    
    \item Email \& communication management, along with calendars, etc. also must be good.
    
    \item Robustness of this system will reduce the amount of things you redo \& clarify. So don't take it for granted!
    
    \item Sticky notes, mindmaps? or brainstorming!
\end{itemize}
