There are 6 skills I need to learn to become a good collaborator / researcher. These are just things I have identified for now. The logic is—if you can see a gap $\rightarrow$ close it. So these are the gaps/skills I identified:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reading}
    \item \textbf{Writing}
    \item \textbf{Thinking/Style}
    \item \textbf{Presentation}
    \item \textbf{Strategy}
    \item \textbf{Taste / Problem Selection / Directions}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{(By) Till April'26 I want to:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop good taste.
    \item Improve my technical skills.
    \item Develop a more robust publishing system.
    \item Improve grit $\rightarrow$ leading to atleast 1 breakthrough of your own.
    \item Improve upon my strategy longterm \& also apply to places now. (Funding?, opportunities, grad school, etc.)
    \item Be able to discuss my work and others better. $\rightarrow$ Develop a good vocabulary \& comfort with talking technically \& otherwise. $\rightarrow$ think about how you want your network to look like $\rightarrow$ who are the people you want to know.
    \item Get a 9.5+ CPI.
    \item Have better discipline in non-academic aspects $\rightarrow$ sleep, play, music, meditation \& recreation.
\end{enumerate}
